WelcomeMessage = """Welcome to 'Snake App' Coded by me, Jean Pierre Paterson(ALGORITHM),
and my best friend, Logan Fritz(MAGIC),we have been friends for over four years now and
this is actually his App, i am just doing the main coding work for him.
He did all the research and we both have past experiences with handling and keeping snakes.
Originally we were going to code this app in Visual Basic, but then we thought that
it would be better and also way more awesome for us to write a snake app in a language that
is named after a snake just to show our dedication and love for snakes...
In this app you will find the following things:

1) Different types of Vangs
2) Different types of Venom
3) Different types of Snakes
4) First aid procedures
5) Tips for if you catching snakes
6) Tips for if you want a snake as a pet

Please use the menu above to navigate through the App, we made it as simple as possible .
We also added navigation buttons for easy navigation from page to page.
Thank you for supporting 1337Software
ENJOY!!

BitisArietans = """Name : Bitis arietans – Puff Adder
Extremely Venomous :
    (Cytotoxic) Causes massive tissue destruction,often if left untreated,
    will cause gangrene and necrosis which is extremely painful and will ultimately lead to an amputation of the envenomated limb.
    Do not try blocking the venom as it will cause the limb to be amputated because of lack blood flow (dilution).
    It is vital to remain calm and get to your nearest hospital as soon as possible so antivenom can be administered under doctor’s supervision.
    Fortunately it is slow acting venom but it is extremely toxic and destructive to flesh. 
Length:
     90cm average
Vangs:
     Solenoglyphs (Front Hinged)
About:
    Active during day and night
    The puff adder is a slow moving snake often seen using the caterpillar locomotion (movement),
    however don’t let his speed confuse you. This is one of the fastest striking snakes in the world.
    Its strike is timed to 0.29 seconds forward and back. Lightning speed and precise accuracy,
    always striking and envenomating, seldom missing its target.
    The puff adder has got a bad temper if  disturbed, often inflating its body (hence the name Puff Adder) and hissing.
    Its coloration on its body can blend in with almost any surrounding and that is why the puff adder is potentially the
    most dangerous in all of Africa because it cannot be seen even when you know it’s there,
    it’s the most widespread snake in Africa ,extremely toxic and has a lightning fast strike.
    It is also known for not retreating like most snakes, the puff adder will lie dead still,
    depending on his camouflage and what happens is someone will come along, not seeing the snake,
    step on it and end up losing a limb or even his/her life if left untreated. Feeds on rats, mice ,
    small mammals and ground birds. Females are Viviparous (Live Birth) and has 20-40 young in summer.
Identification:
    Thick bodied snake 
    Triangular shaped head
    Yellow – Brown Chevron markings along body (triangular markings)
    Sandy brown / Grey in coloration 
"""

BitisAtropas = """Name : Bitis atropas – Berg Adder
Venomous:
     (Neurotoxic and Cytotoxic) unlike its family,
     the berg adder has a weak venom which affects the optic and facial nerves (cranial nerves),
     it’s often been compared/described the same as that of intoxication, drooping eyelids, dizziness,
     loss of taste and smell and seldom causing necrosis.
     Fortunately it is only temporary and will recover in a few days without antivenom,
     if antivenom is administered by a doctor, it may cause side effects, no deaths recorded.
Length: 
     40cm average  
Vangs:
     Solenoglyphs (Front hinged vangs)
About:
     Active during day 
     Endemic to Southern Africa
     Found in Mountainous regions of Southern Africa (hence the name Berg, translated means mountain)
     It is Aggressive hissing loudly and striking violently, even when out of range.
     Feeds on Lizards, birds, rodents and small amphibians
     Viviparous (Live Birth) Females give birth to 4-15 young in summer
Identification:
     Triangular shaped head 
     Triangular shaped markings along the back of snake’s body
     Grey – Black / reddish brown in colour

BitisGabonica = """Namw : Bitis gabonica – Gaboon Adder
Extremely Venomous:
     (Neurotoxic and Cytotoxic)
"""
CaususRhombeatus = """Name : Causus rhombeatus – Common Night Adder
Venomous:
     (Cytotoxic) causing swelling around envenomated wound and tissue destruction (necrosis).
     If bitten, get to hospital as soon as possible and do not isolate the flow of venom as
     that will worsen the condition.
Length:
     50cm average 
Vangs:
     Solenoglyphs (Front Hinged fangs)
About:
     Active during night
     This is a docile snake and will often move away if confronted.
     If molested it will react violently, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly.
     The Common Night Adder has venom glands that are longer than the usual Vipers/Adders.
     The venom glands extend back into the neck region.
     This design allows the Common Night Adder to inject more venom into target.
     Some of its targets (diet) are amphibians such as toads and frogs.
     Females are Oviparous and lays 12-26 eggs in summer.
Identification:
     V shaped marking on the neck behind head.
     This distinct feature can be seen from above of snakes head. It is brown – black in colour.
     Distinctive pale brown-black blotches (pattern) along body and belly is lighter than body colour.
     Dark brown /grey-black in coloration.
"""
HaemoToxic = """Hemotoxic (Haemotoxic, Hematotoxic) Venom
     This type of snake venom destroys red blood cells – causes hemolysis,
     disrupts blood clotting, and also attacks other types of cells and tissues –
     causing profound tissue damage and often, organ failure. These types of bites are very painful.
     Effects may not begin for hours after a bite. Permanent tissue damage almost always results.
     A person bitten by a snake with hemotoxic venom may bleed from orifices like nose,
     eyes, and also gums and the brain.If you are bitten on the toe, finger,
     or some extremity you can usually expect to lose part or all of that body part.
     Malayan Pit Viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) venom has properties of its venom that attacks blood and live tissue.
     Viperkeeper at Youtube calls them “finger rotters”. Their venom literally kills and dissolves tissue including bone.
     Death can result from untreated bites. Indeed more people die in Thailand from the Malayan Pit viper than any other snake.
     More people die across the globe from the Russel’s Viper (Chain Viper) than any other snake in the world.
     These Thailand snakes have Hemotoxic (Haemotoxic) venom: Russell’s Viper (Chain Viper),
     Malayan Pit Viper and all of the Green Pit vipers.Haemorrhagic Envenoming–
     Causes bleeding from a number of orifices including the mouth (gums),
     gastro-intestinal bleeding, bleeding from the urethra, ears, nose, eyes,
     and recent and incompletely healed lacerations to the skin. A number of snakes can cause this,
     including the Malayan pit viper (C. rhodostoma) and the Red-necked Keelback (Rhabdophis subminiatus).
     Incoagulable blood, thrombocytopenia and vessel wall
     damage can combine to cause massive internal bleeding.

Hemotoxin
     Hemotoxins, haemotoxins or hematotoxins are toxins that destroy red blood cells (that is, cause hemolysis),
     disrupt blood clotting, and/or cause organ degeneration and generalized tissue damage.
     The term hemotoxin is to some degree a misnomer since toxins that damage the blood also damage other tissues.
     Injury from a hemotoxic agent is often very painful and can cause permanent damage and in severe cases death.
     Loss of an affected limb is possible even with prompt treatment.

Hemotoxins are frequently employed by venomous animals, including vipers and pit vipers.
Animal venoms contain enzymes and other proteins that are hemotoxic or neurotoxic or occasionally both (as in the Mojave Rattlesnake,
the Japanese mamushi,[1] and similar species). In addition to killing the prey, part of the function of a hemotoxic venom for some animals is to aid digestion.
The venom breaks down protein in the region of the bite, making prey easier to digest.
The process by which a hemotoxin causes death is much slower than that of a neurotoxin.
Snakes which envenomate a prey animal may have to track the prey as it flees. Typically, a mammalian prey item will stop fleeing not because of death,
but due to shock caused by the venomous bite. Symptoms are dependent upon species, size, location of bite and the amount of venom injected. In humans,
symptoms include nausea, disorientation, and headache; these may be delayed for several hours.
Hemotoxins are used in diagnostic studies of the coagulation system. Lupus anticoagulans is detected by changes in the dilute Russell's viper venom time (DRVVT),
which is a laboratory assay based on—as its name indicates—venom of the Russell's viper.
"""
CytoToxic = """Cytotoxic Venom
     Attacks and kills living cells of all sorts. In humans,
     bites from snakes with cytotoxic venom produce severe local and organ related symptoms, bleeding, swelling and pain.
     These Thailand snakes have Cytotoxic venom: King Cobra, Monocled and Indochinese Spitting Cobras.
     I have heard it said that Thailand has more variety (types) of venomous snakes than anywhere else in the world.
     If you are bitten – get to the emergency room of the hospital as fast as possible.
     Venomous snake antivenin is created by injecting small amounts of diluted snake venom into horses.
     Horses produce antibodies that fight the venom. The antibodies are then separated from the blood and used to create the antivenin for humans.
     There are antivenins produced in Bangkok at the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (QSMI) Also known as the Red Cross Snake Farm.
     Here is a list of the antivenins made at QSMI:
       •  Trimeresurus (Cryptelytrops) albolabris: for green tree vipers
       •  Calloselasma rhodostoma: for Malayan pit viper
       •  Daboia russelii: for Russell’s viper
       •  Bungarus fasciatus: for kraits
       •  Ophiophagus hannah: for king cobra
       •  Naja kaouthia: for cobras and spitting cobras
     This list was by Michael Cota, resident Thailand researcher.
     As you can see in the list of snakes that match the venom types –
     there are multiple snakes listed in some cases. Some snakes have venom which fall into more than one category.
     Monocled cobras (Naja kaouthia) have venom that is primarily neurotoxic, but,
     it also has hemotoxic properties and causes necrosis of tissue at the bite site. I know of one case personally where a man,
     bit on the toe by Naja kaouthia, lost his lower leg, then entire leg, and then died anyway about twenty days after the bite.

The categories of snake venom are not complete without mentioning the major effects of some other snakes that don’t fit into the nice categories listed above.
The rear-fanged colubrids, some considered venomous, and some not, have the ability to cause anaphylactoid reactions –
which can shut down the bite victim’s respiratory system. Herpetologists and other snake enthusiasts frequently carry ephinephrine (oral steroid)
inhalers into the field to take in case breathing starts to close down, the inhalers can open the airways somewhat –
ensuring enough oxygen can reach the lungs and blood.
Red-necked keelback snakes (Rhabdophis subminiatus) , once thought harmless,
are now known to possess a venom that attacks the renal system (kidneys) of the bite victim, eventually causing renal failure and,untreated –
death. There are a couple of cases in the literature of this snake causing serious damage to victims of bites that didn’t remove the snake from their body immediately.
In one case the man let the snake bite into him for about two minutes,
he reported. He had major issues and was in the hospital for weeks – doctors were not at all sure he would survive.

"""
NeuroToxic = """Neurotoxic Venom
     Affects the nerves and nervous system.
     There may be little pain or swelling when bitten by a snake with predominantly neurotoxic venom like that of Thailand’s kraits.
     Once bitten a human has a progressive paralyzation of the muscles of the body,
     followed by death from respiratory failure as your diaphragm fails to work anymore.
     Initially an envenomated bite causes ptosis, droopy eyelids, seeing double, and a sleepy, dazed-like paralysis.There is sometimes excess salivation and vomiting.
     Pre-synaptic neurotoxins are found in Thailand elapids and some vipers.
     These damage nerve endings. Post-synaptic neurotoxins are found in elapid venom and block acetylcholine from binding –
     leading to a neuromuscular paralysis. These Thailand snakes have Neurotoxic venom: King Cobra (Ophiophagus hannah),
     Monocled and Indochinese, and Equatorial Spitting Cobras (GenusNaja), Banded kraits (Bungarus fasciatus), Blue kraits (Bungarus candidus),
     Red headed Krait (Bungarus flaviceps), and the coral snakes (GenusCalliophis).

Neurotoxin
     Neurotoxins are toxins that are poisonous or destructive to nerve tissue (causing neurotoxicity).
     Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue.
     The term can also be used to classify endogenous compounds, which, when abnormally contact,can prove neurologically toxic.
     Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems.
     Common examples of neurotoxins include lead, ethanol (drinking alcohol), manganese glutamate, nitric oxide (NO), botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox), tetanus toxin,
     and tetrodotoxin. Some substances such as nitric oxide and glutamate are in fact essential for proper function of the body and only exert neurotoxic effects at
     excessive concentrations.

Neurotoxins inhibit neuron control over ion concentrations across the cell membrane, or communication between neurons across a synapse.
Local pathology of neurotoxin exposure often includes neuron excitotoxicity or apoptosis but can also include glial cell damage.
Macroscopic manifestations of neurotoxin exposure can include widespread central nervous system damage such as intellectual disability,
persistent memory impairments, epilepsy, and dementia. Additionally, neurotoxin-mediated peripheral nervous system damage such as neuropathy or myopathy is common.
Support has been shown for a number of treatments aimed at attenuating neurotoxin-mediated injury, such as antioxidant and antitoxin administration.
"""
MyoToxic = """Myotoxic Venom
     Affects muscle tissue primarily. This venom affects the ability of the muscles to contract –
     leaving the prey flaccid and easy to eat. If a human is bitten it results in pain the legs, hips and shoulders –
     with paralysis the main danger at first. Damage to kidneys follows.
     About a quarter (25%) of bite victims have sever muscle and/or kidney damage from this venom.

Myotoxin
     Myotoxins are small, basic peptides found in snake venoms, (e.g. rattlesnakes),
     and lizard venoms (e.g. mexican beaded lizard).
     This involves a non-enzymatic mechanism that leads to severe muscle necrosis.
     These peptides act very quickly,
     causing instantaneous paralysis to prevent prey from escaping and eventually death due to diaphragmactic paralysis.

The first myotoxin to be identified and isolated was crotamine,
from the venom of Crotalus durissus terrificus,
a tropical South American rattlesnake,
by Brazilian scientist José Moura Gonçalves,
in the 1950s. Its biological actions,
molecular structure and gene responsible for its synthesis were all elucidated in the last two decades
